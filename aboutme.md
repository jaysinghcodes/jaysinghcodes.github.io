title: About me
---

I am a fourth-year undergraduate at THE Ohio State University pursuing a degree in Computer Science & Engineering, I am driven by a passion for technology and innovation. My interests span across a diverse range of fields, including Software Development & Design, Data Engineering, Analytics, Project Management, Consulting, Logistics, and Production.

I am known for my unwavering motivation and dedication, which I bring to every professional endeavor. With a knack for thriving in both collaborative team settings and leadership roles, I approach challenges with enthusiasm and a proactive mindset. My adaptability allows me to seamlessly transition between projects, while my appetite for learning ensures I can quickly grasp new concepts and technologies.

When I get time, I like to produce music and indulge myself in some acrylic painting.
